    <h2 class="title">Persistent Data Versus API</h2>
    <div class="post">
        
<p>Let me just start out with a blanket fact, "I hate databases".  I don't particularly like having to save data, dealing with state is probably the most annoying aspect of software architecture, beating out even graphical user interfaces.  I am particularly fond of APIs and any well defined interfaces, using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection">Dependency Injection</a> to abstract away knowledge of any implementation details.  Interfaces let the software developer focus on the business logic and less on the infrastructure.  Nobody likes dealing with the non-value added part of any solution, or the "common task" especially when it is setting up infrastructure.</p>

<p>So you want to write a service, or perhaps a website with dynamic content.  While doing so you will definitely run across various aspects or obsticles to delievring value.  A service has a defined business purpose, and best case scenario would be to choose a DSL (Domain Specific Language) to write your business logic and simply write your service in that DSL.  Without getting into the many issues about programming in different languages, each one has its benefits and disadvantages.  So you evaluate all the languages, and then choose the one that best allows the development of a solution in that space.  Maybe it is <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> to host a website, or Facebook to host your physical event.  In the end you are choosing some engine and DSL to program, C++, a text editor, or website entry forms, and that is what matters to you.  It matters because your business logic is what you care about most, so being able to best describe it, allows you to provide as much value as possible.  What if the Facebook event system didn't allow to specify a location, would you still use that DSL, website, tool?  Maybe, but weighing the benefits would be a requirement.  How much effort would you be willing to expend to help design the system that would allow you to perfectly specify your business logic?  For me that is epsilon (quickly approaching zero).  The reason it is epsilon, is because there is no new software, everything has been done before.  What I need is a solution that perfectly matches my use case, but requires no more than my understanding.</p>

<p>As an expert in software engineering, I think I can finally say that, I don't want to fight with the environment, DSL, or architecture to produce and program my business logic.</p>
