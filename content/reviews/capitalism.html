    <h2 class="title">Capitalism in Software Development</h2>
    <div class="post">
        
<p>Remaining competitive in distributing software products requires a process which reinforces positive behavior while dispelling the bad.  Often is the case where the need for innovation exists and the members of the organization are intelligent and driven to find it, but in the end are unsuccessful. This lack of fulfillment can be attributed to both startups and vastly diverse and large companies, though ultimately the size is not the important factor.  The last missing piece is the cultivation of innovation and leadership.</p>

<p>Historically, organizations have survived without this direct interaction for a variety of reasons, e.g. lack of competitors, clear customer requirements, or random luck.  When taking a look at the problem statement attempting to be solved--how to sell X--organizations compete with each other.  The result is usually entities battling to control market share, resulting in some reducing prices, improving product, or finding a new market.  This is Capitalism.  The drive of demand for a product causes inherent improvements of the overall product, and the market itself evolves.  The result is that the customer wins.  Natural leaders in market arise and in an effort to continuously innovate, new advances continue to arise.  Given these results, let’s apply Capitalism as a process strategy to software development.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, synthetic innovation and leadership can be achieved by injecting in a process by which those qualities are inherent to the system.  Taking from Capitalism, an organization can radically achieve successes, by creating processes and management structures that closely emulate capitalism.  This can be done by allowing self organizing autonomous teams to compete for clear visible customer desires.  By accepting the system of Capitalism, in which the outside market already functions, an organization will inherently gain the advantages that are normally reserved for larger systems.</p>

<p>For example, when needing improved battery design for Tesla, Elon Musk is quoted as saying: “What we’re going to do is move forward with more than one state, at least two, all the way to breaking ground, just in case there’s last-minute issues. The No. 1 thing is we want to minimize the risk timing for the Gigafactory to get up and running.”  And why not?  Having two plants to both compete and succeed drives benefits for all.  If one plant would fail, the company isn’t in jeopardy.  If the other would succeed, we can share technology, and reward that one.</p>

<p>As with any system there are obvious objections.  First and foremost is the idea that internal teams may compete for resources.  Another is duplication of work.  Lastly, giving up command of the system to individual teams is counter to conventional wisdom.  All these statements are true, but their impact is negligible.  Ultimately, teams created will try optimize for what they value most.  So let them figure that out, they are the experts in that area, and thus it is unlikely even the CEO knows how to do that function better.  Internal competitors will cause each team to value internal resources rather than abuse them.  A common retort is “we have $100” left in the budget, so we have to spend it to get the same amount next year.”  Avoiding a system where that is true in paramount.  Lastly, duplication of work is inevitable, especially of failed experiments on the way to success.  Even Edison is quoted as saying, “I didn’t fail. I just found 2,000 ways not to make a lightbulb; I only needed to find one way to make it work.”</p>

<p>Gain the benefits of Capitalism by injecting competition and rewards into an organization.  The result will be innovation and leadership, and everyone will succeed.</p>

<p>I have talked about “rewards, “competition”, and of course “capitalism”, but how could you use this theory in practice?  One way is to doll out fictitious company dollars $C, for each product.  Rather than seeing the sales team as earning money, and the manufacturing team as a cost center.  You could treat the manufacturing team and the sales teams as separate entities.  The manufacturing team sells their product to the sales team, who in turns sells it externally.  If the manufacturing team thinks they could get more money from selling it straight, then naturally we would question what’s the point of the sales team.  Likewise, if the sales team thought they could sell a product the manufacturing team wasn't making, they may have an additional service to provide.  Teams need to create value added processes, using internal monetary system is one of those ways.</p>

<p>Since each team is ultimately responsible for their own success, if truly treated as an internal startup, full budget could be assigned to that division, including the wages for the whole team.  That team or squad could decide what to do with those funds, including paying themselves.  What is important, is not how much everyone is paid, who controls that, or whether other teams see it as fair, but rather that each team is positively contributing to the success of the company, following the mission laid forth, and using their collective abilities to support the global entities values.</p>
