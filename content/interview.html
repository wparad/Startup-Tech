        <p><h4><strong>Balancing Marbles (aka Apply systematic elimination)</strong></h4></p>
        <p>Given 12 identical appearing marbles, where 11 of them are the same, and the twelth is either lighter or heavier than the other eleven.
        Using a balance only three, how can you determine which marble is the twelth one and whether it is lighter or heaver than the other eleven?</p>
        <p>A simpler version:</p>
        Suppose you have 8 marbles and a two-pan balance used to compare the weight of 2 things. All of the marbles weigh the same except for one, which is heavier than all of the others. How would you find the heaviest marble if you are only allowed to weigh the marbles 2 times?
